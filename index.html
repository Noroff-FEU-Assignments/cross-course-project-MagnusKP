    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">[To avoid web security attacks I would advise a potential client to be aware of the different cyber attacks: Cross-site scripting, SQL injection, Cross site request forgery.
        To prevent web security attacks practices like sanaitization of data is used. This means to manually or through programs ensure that the data running trough a system is in the right format.  Third-party solutions like NodeJS and ORM are suggested. 
        To ensure a secure authorization and authentication is another important step to web security. Authorization and authentication needs to be hard to crack. Open-standard authorization protocol such as OneLogin is recommended. To be aware of what network to connect to and where the website is hosted is an important and a front-end developers responsibility. CI/CD tools are used to run code through to discover rejections or be flagged to rework.
